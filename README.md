# JavaChatApp
__Description__

A minor chat application in java that helps with server and client relationships using sockets and GUI creation and creating multiple threads through multithreading that I managed to build in order to enhance my knowledge in server client architecture as well as multithreading

 **Instructions**

__Please Run this first__
To run the app you first run the server by runniing the ChatServer file in you java IDE for me it was netbeans IDE,*I highly reccomend it*
Doing this will then allow you to set up the main server that will act as the midpoint in the app
Once you do this youll get "server started. waiting for clients..." in your output: You have now set up a new server on your localhost machine running on port 5000

You then run the ChatGui file
You will then be prompted to input your username 
You will need to run this twice in order to instanciate various clients as they will be each threaded separately in the server 
Onc you are in the GUI you will type whichever message you please in the messsagebox in the bottom then press enter to send and doing that will broadcast the message to various instances with the timestamp and the username respectively and in order to close the application you press the exit button next to the messagebox

__Permissions__
Feel free to add anything to help enhance the app it will be mucgh appreciated as well as elaborating on where improvements were made as I will be doing the same over time
